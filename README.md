## 🎛 Chat Overlay Architecture

UI overlay and interaction state is separated into dedicated, component-scoped services to keep the main component lean and maintainable.

**Overlay & interaction services**

* `ChatOverlayService` → Handles overlay + modal UI state
* `ChatControllerService` → Handles message state, editing, reactions, mentions

This separation ensures:

* Clear responsibility boundaries
* Cleaner ChatComponent code
* Easier scaling of UI features

---

## 💬 Chat Component Architecture

`ChatComponent` uses **locally provided services** for feature isolation.

```text
ChatComponent
 ├── ChatControllerService   → Messages, editing, reactions, mentions
 ├── ChatOverlayService      → Overlay + modal state
 ├── ChatService             → Firestore communication
 ├── MentionService          → Mention parsing & filtering
 └── ActionService           → Emoji + editing helpers
```

---

## 🧩 Responsibility Split

### ChatControllerService

Handles:

* Message state
* Sending messages
* Editing messages
* Emoji insertion
* Reaction toggling
* Mention insertion
* Hover states

### ChatOverlayService

Handles:

* Channel overlays
* Member overlays
* Add member dialogs
* Profile overlays
* Mobile overlay states
* Focus handling

---

## 🏗 Architecture Principles

* **Service-driven logic separation**
  Business logic moved out of components

* **Scoped providers per feature**
  Chat services exist only inside ChatComponent

* **Reactive chat switching (RxJS)**
  Live message updates on channel change

* **Optimistic UI updates**
  Reactions & edits update instantly

* **Overlay state isolation**
  UI state separated from data state

---

## 📦 Why Scoped Services?

Only `ChatComponent` uses:

* `ChatControllerService`
* `ChatOverlayService`

Benefits:

* No global state pollution
* Easier debugging
* Independent feature scaling
* Cleaner dependency graph

## 📂 Firestore Structure

    channels/
      {channelId}
        name
        description
        creator
        users[]

    messages/
      {messageId}
        text
        uid
        timestamp
        reactions{}

        thread/
          {threadMessageId}

    whispers/
      {combinedUserId}
        messages/

## 🛡 Validation & Security

- Channel membership verification
- Duplicate channel name prevention
- Trimmed & normalized channel names
- Controlled reaction toggling
- Mention input sanitation

---

## 🖥 Responsive Design

- Desktop-first layout
- Mobile channel drawer
- Adaptive overlays
- Max-width content container
- Breakpoint-based UI switching

---

## ⚙️ Installation

git clone `git@github.com:Uteki/DABubble.git`

cd chat-app

npm install

ng serve

Open: http://localhost:4200

## 🔑 Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project

2. Enable:
   
   - Authentication (Email + Google)
   - Firestore Database

3. Add your config to:

src/environments/environment.ts

Example:

    export const environment = {
      firebase: {
        apiKey: "...",
        authDomain: "...",
        projectId: "...",
        storageBucket: "...",
        messagingSenderId: "...",
        appId: "..."
      }
    };

- Typing indicators
- Idle Track
- Read receipts
- File uploads
- Drag & drop attachments
- Push notifications
- Firestore security rules hardening
